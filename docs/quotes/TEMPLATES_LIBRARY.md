# Templates Library — Quotes

Admins can manage reusable content and templates for quotes. Templates apply to UI and PDF.

## Types
- Document templates: minimal, detailed, construction/services, SaaS
- Boilerplate blocks:
  - Terms & Conditions
  - Payment instructions
  - Delivery terms
  - Warranty/Service info
  - Legal footers (by country/sector)

## Localization
- Each block has versions in EN/FR/DE/TR. Fallback to company default language if missing.

## Assignment
- Templates can be assigned by:
  - Sector (services, construction, retail, SaaS)
  - Country (US, FR, TR, DE)
  - Organization default (company-level default)

## Editing & Versioning
- Changes tracked with version history; previous versions remain selectable.

## Preview
- Live preview using a sample quote (with company and bank info pulled from records).
