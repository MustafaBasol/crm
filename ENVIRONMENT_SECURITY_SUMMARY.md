# Environment Separation & Security Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment File Separation

- **✅ Created `/apps/web/.env.example`** - Contains only VITE\_ prefixed variables (publicly visible)
- **✅ Created `/apps/api/.env.example`** - Contains all server secrets (never exposed to client)
- **✅ Updated `.gitignore`** - Properly excludes all environment files from version control
- **✅ Updated root `.env.example`** - Removed server secrets, added security warnings

### 2. Web Server Security

- **✅ Created `vite.config.production.ts`** - Production-ready Vite configuration
- **✅ Created `build-production.sh`** - Automated build script with security verification
- **✅ Implemented secret scanning** - Prevents server secrets from being bundled in client code
- **✅ Created `main.production.ts`** - Secure backend configuration with proper CORS and security headers

### 3. Deployment Documentation

- **✅ Created comprehensive `docs/deployment.md`** with:
  - Nginx configuration with security headers, rate limiting, TLS
  - Caddy configuration (alternative reverse proxy)
  - CORS allowlist configuration
  - TLS/HTTPS setup with Let's Encrypt
  - PM2 and systemd process management
  - Health check implementations
  - Security checklist and monitoring

### 4. Additional Security Tools

- **✅ Created `scripts/security-verify.sh`** - Automated security verification
- **✅ Created `scripts/setup-production.sh`** - Production environment setup
- **✅ Created health check scripts** - Application monitoring
- **✅ Implemented secure file permissions** - Environment files protected (600)

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### Environment Separation

```bash
# Frontend (publicly visible)
VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Comptario

# Backend (server secrets only)
DATABASE_PASSWORD=secure_password
JWT_SECRET=256_bit_secret_key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=server_encryption_key
```

### Build Security

- ✅ Server secrets never exposed in client bundle
- ✅ Automated scanning during build process
- ✅ Source maps excluded from production builds
- ✅ Security headers configured

### Network Security

- ✅ API server binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1)
- ✅ Reverse proxy handles public traffic
- ✅ CORS allowlist configured
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented
- ✅ TLS/HTTPS enforced

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria Status

### ✅ No server secrets referenced in client bundle

- Implemented automated scanning in `build-production.sh`
- Clear separation between VITE\_ (public) and server-only variables
- Security verification script confirms no secrets in dist/

### ✅ Deployment documentation includes minimal configs

- **Nginx configuration**: Complete with security headers, rate limiting, TLS
- **Caddy configuration**: Alternative reverse proxy setup
- **Process management**: Both PM2 and systemd configurations
- **Health checks**: Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Security checklist**: Pre and post-deployment verification

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Development

```bash
# Use existing environment files
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

### For Production

```bash
# Run the production setup script
./scripts/setup-production.sh

# Build with security verification
./build-production.sh

# Verify security configuration
./scripts/security-verify.sh

# Deploy using reverse proxy (see docs/deployment.md)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Environment Variable Handling

- **Frontend**: Only `VITE_` prefixed variables are bundled
- **Backend**: All sensitive variables remain server-side only
- **Build Process**: Automated verification prevents secret exposure

### Reverse Proxy Configuration

- **Nginx**: Production-ready with security headers
- **Caddy**: Alternative with automatic HTTPS
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse

### Process Management

- **PM2**: Cluster mode with auto-restart and logging
- **Systemd**: Service configuration with security restrictions
- **Health Checks**: Automated monitoring and alerting

## 🛡️ Security Hardening

### File System Security

- Environment files have 600 permissions
- Build output contains no source code or secrets
- Log files are properly secured

### Network Security

- API server only accessible via reverse proxy
- CORS properly configured with allowlist
- TLS 1.2+ enforced with strong ciphers

### Application Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers implemented
- Rate limiting and abuse protection

## 📊 Verification Commands

```bash
# Security verification
./scripts/security-verify.sh

# Build verification
./build-production.sh

# Health check
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Production setup
./scripts/setup-production.sh
```

All acceptance criteria have been met with comprehensive security hardening and production-ready deployment configurations.
